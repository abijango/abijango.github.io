    <p>Amazing interview. From the scale of Amazon's operations, to the forward thinking ideas (some very sci-fi), and just the general philosophy. Jeff Bezos:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeff Bezos: The long term approach is rare enough that it means you're not competing against very many companies. &lsquo;Cause most companies wanna see a return on investment in, you know, one, two, three years.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Charlie Rose: You donâ€™t care about that?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeff Bezos: I care, but I'm willing for it to be five, six, seven years. So just that change in timeline can be a very big competitive advantage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are still in it for the money, just not at the expense of the customer, or to leech every little drop of profit in the short term. I mean they are making money of us, the customers, but why shouldn't they? They are providing an amazing service. Next-day delivery here in UK with Amazon Prime; and after using it for a year plus, I think it is just amazing. I find more and more reasons to order through Amazon than other places these days.</p>
<p>Granted the idea of the delivery drones might not work out to be cost-effective; but just the fact that they are trying these things is amazing. Just like Google with their famous driverless-cars and other crazy projects that make no sense in the short term, and have a lot of naysayers having a mad crazy-fest at their expense.</p>
<p>Jeff Bezos is a realist it seems, he knows Amazon won't be around forever, he even quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Companies have short life spans Charlie. And Amazon will be disrupted one day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the real fact is, with all their operations and amazing R&amp;D that is going into delaying that day, I think this last quote sums up his philosophy perfectly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would love for it to be after I'm dead.</p>
