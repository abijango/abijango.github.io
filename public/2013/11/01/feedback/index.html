    <p>So I have had some feedback from some of you who have read the recent posts (I know they are not a lot). And it has been most helpful.</p>
<p>Basic points that came out of the feedback are summarised as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Injustice posts seem to be mostly rambling. I understand that these are first drafts that were mainly published to get feedback from you guys in the first place, but that does not excuse bad quality.</li>
<li>Other stories I got most positive feedback and was encouraged to write more of that stuff. I hear ya&rsquo; and will deliver.</li>
<li>Regular updates. I have not been posting on a regular schedule and will strive to make that happen.</li>
</ol>
<p>Just as an update of sorts, I tweeted recently:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As I noted later, that doesn't mean much when it's not in publishable state (as per point 1. above). But I will clean it all up and try to publish it in smaller readable chunks.</p>
<p>For long for reading, I do recommend picking up a long-form reading services such as <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>, or <a href="http://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a>. Both have excellent mobile apps and are great for downloading long-form articles for reading offline.</p>
<p>Or as I do, link up my favourite reading websites to some RSS service, <a href="www.feedly.com">Feedly</a> is an excellent service that is free and hooks up to almost all good RSS clients on mobile. I wrote an post about <a href="http://abijango.com/rss-and-other-things/">RSS</a> before, do give it a read.</p>
