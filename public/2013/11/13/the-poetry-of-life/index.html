    <p>I have been thinking a lot about the current state of my life. How much time I spend working, and the whole &lsquo;work-life balance issue&rsquo;. Personally, as a lot of others have stated before as well, I believe the whole term &lsquo;work-life balance&rsquo; is flawed.</p>
<p>As the argument goes, work is part of life, not a separate entity. And we consider life to be worth a lot less than work. After all you need to work to make a living right? Work provides a salary that you can use to rent and bills. Afford all the luxuries of our modern life. And all that good stuff.</p>
<p>But as we all find out eventually, we prioritize work so much during our 20s and 30s, by the time we have enough money (which is a flawed thinking in itself, what is enough money?) most of our youth has passed us by. We go on a crazy spree, as most would call it, mid-life crises. Buy a fancy car or what not. Mainly because this is when we mostly stop to think, what have I been doing all this time?</p>
<p>We miss out on family events, birthdays, weddings, other social gatherings for work. We always put it off saying, <em>There will be time later for this.</em> But there never is, is there? I know I can't really complain. I am not that old, just in my late 20s, and I have spent this decade of my life mostly, if not all dedicated to work/study. Graduating from college straight into my first real job. Working hours on end, a lot of it without sleep. Achieving a lot, but in the end sacrificing a lot more.</p>
<p>Would I do it all over again? Probably. But I will be under no illusions that I prioritized work over life. I chose to give more time to work over family and friends and other things, and will probably do that again. But atleast I know I made that choice.</p>
<p>Now today, I make a certain different choice. I am still highly dedicated to my work, I spend around 10-12 hours working a day. But after that I try to enjoy the simple pleasures of life. Writing, reading, playing and listening to music. Maybe a little painting thrown in.</p>
<p>Theres a quote I once read that really stuck with me, I'd like to share it with you now. Poet Billy Collins once wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All babies are born with a knowledge of poetry, because the lub-dub of the mother’s heart is in iambic meter. <strong>Then life slowly starts to choke the poetry out of us.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd like to point out that last part in bold. I thankfully realized it soon, its not a revolutionary thought, countless others have come up with it as well. Work sometimes gives us no choice, fair enough. But realize what it is doing to your &lsquo;life&rsquo;. Don't let the poetry be choked out of you, it is too precious to lose.</p>
