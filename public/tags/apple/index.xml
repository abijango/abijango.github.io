      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s be serious for a second, despite the absurdity of the statements like &amp;lsquo;is Apple the next Blackberry?&amp;rsquo;. The only way Apple could be the next &amp;lsquo;Blackberry&amp;rsquo; is if they do what Blackberry did, i.e. refuse to change and evolve with the marketplace. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen in the past that Apple does not do that. They delay product launches until they know they have a killer, or potentially amazing product. They watch the market like a hawk and work on a product to disrupt the market that actually makes a difference.</description>
