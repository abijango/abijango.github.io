      <description>Absolutely hilarious. I love my hometown, and yes before you ask, it IS better than its twin city. Love how the writer illustrates the different divides within the city with such humour.
There are always comparions made by Lahori-ites and Karachi-ites about how their cities have so much happening, and Islamabad is boring and lame and all that. To that I would like to quote a friend, &amp;ldquo;Jealous not, Darrrlinnnggg!!&amp;rdquo;</description>
