      <description>OMG OMG OMG!
2D Sonic once again! Yay! Childhood favourite game revival. These days nostalgia is all the rage, but still, this is Sonic!
 Sonic Mania, which is being developed by Headcannon and PagodaWest Games in collaboration with Sega and Christian Whitehead, will offer a mix of new levels and updated versions of classic Sonic stages. Sonic the hedgehog, Tails the fox and Knuckles the echidna will all appear in the game.</description>

      <description>One of my favourite shows from childhood, not the original series, but the new one that used to show on cartoon network.
I hope they base it of the new show, with all the Quest World antics!

      <description>Granted I do not reside in the country of my birth anymore, nor have I for the last 5 years. A lot of arguments have been made to me in this regard.
Pakistan is not the same as you remember it to be.
Thinks have changed.
And so on.
Granted those arguments are valid. And the reasons for which I left my country are still valid to this day from when I left.</description>
