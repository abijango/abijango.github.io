      <description>Star Wars has always had a special place in my heart. I write and tweet about it a lot. Maybe too much.
Nah!
After I had devoured the movies over and over again as a kid, I was left hanging. I wanted more. I wanted the Episodes I-III (OK maybe in hindsight I should have been careful what I wished for!), and there was nothing. I am sure it was much worse for the people for whom Star Wars had been a part of their lives since the late 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s.</description>
