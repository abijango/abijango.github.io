      <description>So this just basically means that the new movies could draw their inspiration from some of the richest stories ever told in science fiction. Hell yes!
Here&#39;s to hoping Disney picks up on the nerdgasms this has generated in the Star Wars community and decide to actually pick some of the most amazing story lines for the upcoming movies or animated series/films.
 So if by Episode VIII fans meet Grand Admiral Thrawn, all the better.</description>
