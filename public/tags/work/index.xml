      <description>Just a small reminder to all of us that work environments do not need to be vile swamps filled with politics and nonsense. There are great places to work out there, we just haven&#39;t found them yet.
 The actual company values, as opposed to the nice-sounding values, are shown by who gets rewarded, promoted, or let go
 The excuses that this is the way the work environments are and there is no way to change them is just plain bullshit.</description>
