      <description>OMG OMG OMG!
2D Sonic once again! Yay! Childhood favourite game revival. These days nostalgia is all the rage, but still, this is Sonic!
 Sonic Mania, which is being developed by Headcannon and PagodaWest Games in collaboration with Sega and Christian Whitehead, will offer a mix of new levels and updated versions of classic Sonic stages. Sonic the hedgehog, Tails the fox and Knuckles the echidna will all appear in the game.</description>

      <description>Chris Avellone has been one of my childhood heroes since a friend of mine told me to go read the credits on our favourite game of all time, Fallout 2. Him and the other&#39;s who made the amazing games over at Black Isle Studios just made my childhood amazing.
I now get to see a loot at what he uses as a gaming machine and his general desk and place of work/fun, great insight.</description>
