      <description>I wrote about India&#39;s mission to Mars a while back, and now that spaceship has finally reached Mar&#39;s orbit.
And all of this for less than the cost of what it took to make Gravity.
I think the New York Time&#39;s article say&#39;s it best though.
 One a shoestring, India sends orbiter to Mars on it&#39;s first try.
 The trip cost India $74 million. Gravity on the other hand cost $100 million.</description>
