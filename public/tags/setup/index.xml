      <description>I think finally I would like to write about how this blog is set up, for all you geeks out there, I am sure you might enjoy this.

##Jekyll and all that
Jekyll, is a simple static blogging system, or as they say, blogging for hackers. Basically, it eliminates the database from the backend. All that is there is your content (posts) and that is it.
