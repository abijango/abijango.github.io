      <description>I read an article over at Messy Thoughts which I think is an excellent take on the issue of &amp;lsquo;useless education&amp;rsquo;. Go ahead read it first and come back, I&#39;ll wait.
I am totally for education itself and improving oneself, but to get a degree and not use it, is an insult to education itself. Maybe you say, it is their own (or their parent&#39;s atleast) money, and it is for them to do with as they will.</description>
