      <description>This made me laugh this morning.
 Hackers claim to have stolen the upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean film and are demanding that Disney pay a ransom or else have it released online.

      <description>One of my favourite shows from childhood, not the original series, but the new one that used to show on cartoon network.
I hope they base it of the new show, with all the Quest World antics!

      <description>Where a fan goes the extra mile:
 Stoefller submitted the diorama for French lego contest, along with a fantastical story that offers an alternate take on how Boba survived falling into the Sarlacc during Return of the Jedi.
 The detail is just astonishing.

      <description>Talk about a childhood destroyed. I always thought they created this somehow, miniatures or something. But paintings? Wow!
 Matte paintings are fake sets that—most of the times—used to be made with plexiglass and oil paint. The artists used oversized panels to create the necessary detail that the camera needed to fool the audiences when the film was projected over the large surface of the theater screen. The paintings were combined with live action filmed to match the perspective of the painting.</description>
