      <description>This trailer looks so good. Somehow captures the feel of Star Wars.
Subtle nod to Han shot first ;).</description>

      <description>So many years into Android and the adoption rate of the latest OS version is still a major shit show. OEM&#39;s doing their own thing and carriers opting for their own brand of &amp;ldquo;let&#39;s see how much we can fuck with the customers&amp;rdquo;.
 What a difference between the two platforms. The largest issue caused by this fragmentation is the inability to get critical updates out to the masses. Apple is about to release a brand new OS, and it will work on the vast majority of iPhones in the wild.</description>

Sonic the hedgehog, Tails the fox and Knuckles the echidna will all appear in the game.</description>

      <description>Just a small reminder to all of us that work environments do not need to be vile swamps filled with politics and nonsense. There are great places to work out there, we just haven&#39;t found them yet.
 The actual company values, as opposed to the nice-sounding values, are shown by who gets rewarded, promoted, or let go
 The excuses that this is the way the work environments are and there is no way to change them is just plain bullshit.</description>

      <description>People can&#39;t really be blamed for losing their shit. All the click-bait articles were not helping. But seriously, everything is fine.
 But the “death” of the MP3 is really not much of a death at all. The files will not spontaneously combust. You&#39;ll still be able to buy and use MP3s. They will not suddenly stop playing.
  All this really does is move the classification of MP3 from being recognized as a file format of the moment to being a file format of the past.</description>

      <description>Let&#39;s be serious for a second, despite the absurdity of the statements like &amp;lsquo;is Apple the next Blackberry?&#39;. The only way Apple could be the next &amp;lsquo;Blackberry&amp;rsquo; is if they do what Blackberry did, i.e. refuse to change and evolve with the marketplace. We&#39;ve seen in the past that Apple does not do that. They delay product launches until they know they have a killer, or potentially amazing product. They watch the market like a hawk and work on a product to disrupt the market that actually makes a difference.</description>

 Hackers claim to have stolen the upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean film and are demanding that Disney pay a ransom or else have it released online.

      <description>I read an article on medium, I&#39;m tired of hijab from a lady who seems to be sick of the hijab taking over her life. Or rather, all the important conversations in her life leaving her own personal identity out in the cold.
She has written other articles on the matter, all of them carrying the same tone. Frustration, annoyance, even outright rage. I can not say that I can being to understand the sentiment, only rather I would like to talk about it.</description>

      <description>Getting better TVs is always going to be a good thing for us the consumers. Look at smartphones, if they were taking 5-10 seconds to turn on like TVs do these days, how much would we use them?
And I love the fact that Samsung still doesn&#39;t have a Netflix certified TV :).

      <description>One of my favourite shows from childhood, not the original series, but the new one that used to show on cartoon network.
I hope they base it of the new show, with all the Quest World antics!

      <description>Where a fan goes the extra mile:
 Stoefller submitted the diorama for French lego contest, along with a fantastical story that offers an alternate take on how Boba survived falling into the Sarlacc during Return of the Jedi.
 The detail is just astonishing.

Star Wars at Madame Tussauds will be a unique, immersive experience featuring 16 of the most famous heroes and villains in scenes from some of the most iconic moments featured in Star Wars Episodes I – VI.</description>

      <description>Star Wars has always had a special place in my heart. I write and tweet about it a lot. Maybe too much.
Nah!
After I had devoured the movies over and over again as a kid, I was left hanging. I wanted more. I wanted the Episodes I-III (OK maybe in hindsight I should have been careful what I wished for!), and there was nothing. I am sure it was much worse for the people for whom Star Wars had been a part of their lives since the late 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s.</description>

      <description>What a really thourough investigation. Every single piece of clothing (no shoes sadly) calatalogued. The little nerd in me wants to do re-runs now (No Timothy Dalton, no way!).
 Though there are 28 dinner jackets, there are 29 shirts. George Lazenby wears two different ruffled shirts with the same dinner jacket in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service. Also, shoes are unfortunately missing from this infographic since they are rarely seen in the films.</description>

      <description>Talk about a childhood destroyed. I always thought they created this somehow, miniatures or something. But paintings? Wow!
 Matte paintings are fake sets that—most of the times—used to be made with plexiglass and oil paint. The artists used oversized panels to create the necessary detail that the camera needed to fool the audiences when the film was projected over the large surface of the theater screen. The paintings were combined with live action filmed to match the perspective of the painting.</description>

      <description>Pro-democracy riots in Hong Kong. Note the similarities in the police actions and the reactions by the public to what is recently happening back home in Pakistan.
 The government urdged the protesters to end their sit-in demonstrations.
 Now why would people do that? Why is it that everywhere protests start &amp;ndash; Pakistan, UK, Hong Kong, elsewhere &amp;ndash; the authorities always have their ridiculous demands about not protesting? Why? Other than the authourities, who else benifits from not protesting?</description>

      <description>I wrote about India&#39;s mission to Mars a while back, and now that spaceship has finally reached Mar&#39;s orbit.
And all of this for less than the cost of what it took to make Gravity.
I think the New York Time&#39;s article say&#39;s it best though.
 One a shoestring, India sends orbiter to Mars on it&#39;s first try.
 The trip cost India $74 million. Gravity on the other hand cost $100 million.</description>

      <description>Stories like these might sound sensational to you. Yes they are trying to paint a very bleak picture of our society and the kind of censorship that is prevalent. But it doesn&#39;t change the fact that it is censorship.
 Today&#39;s edition of The International New York Times was stripped of its cover story in Pakistan. Instead of seeing a lengthy report on &amp;ldquo;What Pakistan knew about bin Laden,&amp;rdquo; readers were greeted with an enormous section of white space that dominates the paper&#39;s front page.</description>

      <description>Fight Club is, and always will be one of my favourite movies. Call it a hunger for violence, or a passion for dark gritty stories. I don&#39;t care, I love this movie. And for you who can&#39;t stand the original because of its violence (I pity you!), go ahead and watch this 2 minute version.
It blends the original story with the classic Sega games like Streets of Rage style graphics, classic!</description>

      <description>The Millennium Falcon is no doubt some of the most recognizable nerd craft. The article traces the inspirations:
 The connections begin in the cockpit of the Falcon with its iconic greenhouse-style window. It was here that audiences first jumped to hyperspace, and from these famous viewports that Han Solo evaded Imperial ships in the asteroid field above Hoth. Thirty years earlier, this same style of cockpit was found flying aboard one of the most advanced bomber aircraft of World War II: The American B-29 Superfortress.</description>

      <description>With a 96% critics rating and a 92% audience rating, you know this movie has done something right. It is a family movie, so go in obviously expecting that. But given that, I enjoyed it more than I ever imagined.
The little details, the references. The way the references were handled, even the overall main and underlying stories; typical as they were, were pretty good. Not all entertainment needs to be vulgar to make it big.</description>

      <description>Many of you watch this series, and many of you love it. It may be the acting or the overly dramatized politics. There is no doubt House of Cards is a very popular series, not even going into how amazing it is that Netflix is making such amazing original content, as that is a whole seperate post; let&#39;s talk about its popularity abroad.
To say Chinese people get the wrong idea of American politics by watching this series is again a half statement.</description>

      <description>##Women
All of what is written in the linked article is true, women are generally expected to make all the sacrifices for a marriage; or more accurately, trained to believe to give up all their hopes and dreams and live according to the lives their husbands choose for them.
And no matter how much we want it to be not true, it is. Even the modern woman feels the pressure from family and society to conform to these social norms.</description>

      <description>As we all know, anything to do with Batman gets me excited. Being as they are about to mutilate the origin story once again, I have some very strong thoughts on the matter. Which also brings me to the linked article:
 Here’s what I WOULDN’T do in the pilot: Kill Thomas and Martha Wayne.
 Yes, yes we all know that is the defining moment in Bruce&#39;s career to becoming Batman.</description>

      <description>Absolutely hilarious. I love my hometown, and yes before you ask, it IS better than its twin city. Love how the writer illustrates the different divides within the city with such humour.
There are always comparions made by Lahori-ites and Karachi-ites about how their cities have so much happening, and Islamabad is boring and lame and all that. To that I would like to quote a friend, &amp;ldquo;Jealous not, Darrrlinnnggg!!&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>So it seems like Tony Stark is also a fan of Lego. Or his captors are? In either case it is always pretty funny when movies/series use code copied from somewhere, but in this case it looks like one of the designers had a sense of humour.
 The code above comes from a firmware downloader for the RCX (a programmable, microcontroller-based Lego brick), written in 1998 at Stanford University by Kekoa Proudfoot.</description>

      <description>So this just basically means that the new movies could draw their inspiration from some of the richest stories ever told in science fiction. Hell yes!
Here&#39;s to hoping Disney picks up on the nerdgasms this has generated in the Star Wars community and decide to actually pick some of the most amazing story lines for the upcoming movies or animated series/films.
 So if by Episode VIII fans meet Grand Admiral Thrawn, all the better.</description>

      <description>Totally useless bit of information, but it has nagged me since I saw the movie. My estimates were around ~26km, accounting for the scenes that could have taken place in parallel. Seems like the guys over in BBC had the same idea.
 Our best estimate after calculating plane speed, car speed and simultaneous action sequences is that the runway is 18.37 miles (29.6km) long. Which is still very long when you consider the longest paved runway in the world is the Qamdo Bamda airport in China, at around 3.</description>

I also sketch traditionally sometimes, have for many years; but looking at this, I am blown away. The patience and skill required to do something like this is just staggering. I wish one day I will have even a 10th of what Kyle has.</description>

      <description>Amazing interview. From the scale of Amazon&#39;s operations, to the forward thinking ideas (some very sci-fi), and just the general philosophy. Jeff Bezos:
 Jeff Bezos: The long term approach is rare enough that it means you&#39;re not competing against very many companies. &amp;lsquo;Cause most companies wanna see a return on investment in, you know, one, two, three years.
  Charlie Rose: You don’t care about that?
  Jeff Bezos: I care, but I&#39;m willing for it to be five, six, seven years.</description>

      <description>I read a very thought provoking post over at Messy Thoughts and the following discussion regarding the post was insanely entertaining. Lots of self-righteousness rearing its ugly head and all that fun stuff.
Let me go over into a rant on the subject now. I have been contemplating this whole idea about Religion and Logic and blind-faith and all that stuff for a long time. I am very thankful that I had a grandfather who was very challenging in this regard, always made me question everything and always said:</description>

      <description>Hahahahahahaha.
Ok enough making fun of the situation (not really!). We can all point fingers, but the fact of the matter is, this is extremely sad.
Quick quote:
 &amp;ldquo;The Army lost track of roughly $5.8 billion worth of supplies between 2003 and 2011.&amp;rdquo;
 Kind of reminds me of another army.

      <description>Got linked to this article on Facebook. What an insane story of intelligence and wisom displayed by a maid.
Granted their situation was a difficult one, and it is all on the in-laws of the widow who gave her so much difficulty in the first place, but it is inspiring to know that there are brave and intelligent people out in the world.
The problem of the widow can be summed up in this one sentence:</description>

      <description>Well written article over at the Tribune. I especially like the fact that the write starts to explain what her interpretation of the events of Karballa were, then leaves them out, as that is not what the post was about. It was about one thing, tolerance.
We pride ourselves in being Muslims, followers of the best religion known to mankind. And yet we are the scum of the earth. If something our our religion had actually gone through our goddamn thick skulls we would respect our fellow man&#39;s difference of opinion and let them live their lives in peace.</description>

      <description>The internet is flush with articles on the BatKid story.
 &amp;ldquo;The Make-A-Wish Foundation has often arranged elaborate gifts for kids with life-threatening diseases - but never at this scale&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
  &amp;ldquo;We were here to cheer on Miles, but Miles also helped us&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
 Stories like these start to restore my faith in humanity, but then there are always the naysayers:
 Not everyone felt the love. While city police officials said they handled Friday&#39;s crowds without extra staffing or costs, some thought the event focused too much energy on one child.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: The link post and the following article is extremely graphic. Read at your own risk.
There have been countless stories of abuse in our society, and reading this post, I wanted to highlight how it&#39;s not just us who have this problem; but the cases are highly similar as are their outcomes. The absolutely disgusting behavior occurs everywhere, and though we are no stranger to such stories, it is still worth discussion in my opinion.</description>

      <description>I have been thinking a lot about the current state of my life. How much time I spend working, and the whole &amp;lsquo;work-life balance issue&amp;rsquo;. Personally, as a lot of others have stated before as well, I believe the whole term &amp;lsquo;work-life balance&amp;rsquo; is flawed.
As the argument goes, work is part of life, not a separate entity. And we consider life to be worth a lot less than work. After all you need to work to make a living right?</description>

      <description>So following a discussion on a social media that-must-not-be-named (mainly because I hate it), I decided that a post on my opinions on the matter of State and Religion, or their seperate; was in order.
##Duties of the State
To begin this, let us first think about what the state actually means or what it is supposed to mean/do.
The responsibilities of the state can be broadly described as1:
 Protection: Ensure the safety of the people/citizens.</description>

      <description>Having lived in a western country for the last 5 years, maybe my views have changed on the matter. Then again, they might have just been solidified.
I have no problem with the consumption of alcohol, by a non-muslim or by a muslim. Where I have a problem with, is intoxication and the resulting stupidity that ensues. And then again, that is a personal opinion. I am glad to be living in a country where a &amp;lsquo;majority&amp;rsquo; of people won&#39;t moan at me for my personal opinions.</description>

      <description>I think finally I would like to write about how this blog is set up, for all you geeks out there, I am sure you might enjoy this.
So let us begin!
##Jekyll and all that
Jekyll, is a simple static blogging system, or as they say, blogging for hackers. Basically, it eliminates the database from the backend. All that is there is your content (posts) and that is it. No database to store all that content, and retrive it when a user requests to view a post, hence making it blazing fast.</description>

 Injustice posts seem to be mostly rambling. I understand that these are first drafts that were mainly published to get feedback from you guys in the first place, but that does not excuse bad quality.</description>

      <description>When we talk about abuses of women and generally labour in our country we cry foul at all stages. Women are abused, downtrodden and generally not held in the highest regard in our society. Not taking anything away from those abuses, they are horrible in their own right. But today I wanted to just talk about the post over at BBC that I read a while back. Namely, the abuse of women in Melilla, and specifically their abuse as mules for transport of goods.</description>

      <description>Granted I do not reside in the country of my birth anymore, nor have I for the last 5 years. A lot of arguments have been made to me in this regard.
Pakistan is not the same as you remember it to be.
Thinks have changed.
And so on.
Granted those arguments are valid. And the reasons for which I left my country are still valid to this day from when I left.</description>

      <description>Our neighbours over in India have a plan to launch a space mission to Mars.
 The Mangalyaan probe was to have been launched as early as 28 October, but rough weather in the Pacific forced officials to delay the launch by a week. The unmanned mission has a launch window lasting until 19 November.
 Meanwhile in Pakistan we still concern ourselves with useless issues like what our Northern province should be called?</description>

      <description>The laughter is the first thing that gets to most people. The shriekers, the wailers. And then those who snicker as if they know something you don&#39;t. Makes more than a few wonder if it&#39;s in fact the patients who know more than you. That they are privy to secrets that you are not. Maybe feeling that way is what drives most people away from places like this. An asylum.</description>

Covered in dirt and bird shit and god knows what else.</description>

      <description>I have been writing short stories since I was very young. Most of them used to be nothing more than just childhood fiction. These days I am more interested in writing about certain aspects of my culture. Highlighting certain issues if you will.
The future posts that follow with the titles beginning with &amp;ldquo;Injustice for All&amp;rdquo;, will be part of short stories that are linked in one way or another; and where I try to fit together these disjointed stories about things that I want to highlight about my culture.</description>

      <description>I will start this by saying I attended E&amp;amp;ME College, NUST from 2003-2007. Hence, I have a very personal taste on these issues that everyone is talking about. To get it out of the way, EM&amp;amp;E College, NUST was a horrible place to study. Simply terri-bad. I have spent years of my life after my time there trying to erase it from my memory. Granted I met some of my best friends in that university, but most if not all friendships were based on our mutual hatred of EM&amp;amp;E and its administration.</description>

      <description>I read an article over at Messy Thoughts which I think is an excellent take on the issue of &amp;lsquo;useless education&amp;rsquo;. Go ahead read it first and come back, I&#39;ll wait.
I am totally for education itself and improving oneself, but to get a degree and not use it, is an insult to education itself. Maybe you say, it is their own (or their parent&#39;s atleast) money, and it is for them to do with as they will.</description>

      <description>I will begin this by saying I am not a writer. I have always wanted to be able to write well, but never had the drive or the energy to go ahead and do it. This blog is finally a first step in the journey to becoming a better writer.
As such, this will be a collection of all the small titbits I write, along with links and my personal comments on the articles I find interesting and those that make it to my reading lists.</description>
