  <h3 class="h2 post-title">The Poetry of Life </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">I have been thinking a lot about the current state of my life. How much time I spend working, and the whole &lsquo;work-life balance issue&rsquo;. Personally, as a lot of others have stated before as well, I believe the whole term &lsquo;work-life balance&rsquo; is flawed.
As the argument goes, work is part of life, not a separate entity. And we consider life to be worth a lot less than work. After all you need to work to make a living right?</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">State and Religion: The Need for Seperation </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">So following a discussion on a social media that-must-not-be-named (mainly because I hate it), I decided that a post on my opinions on the matter of State and Religion, or their seperate; was in order.
##Duties of the State
To begin this, let us first think about what the state actually means or what it is supposed to mean/do.
The responsibilities of the state can be broadly described as1:
 Protection: Ensure the safety of the people/citizens.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Alcohol the Deadly Sin </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Having lived in a western country for the last 5 years, maybe my views have changed on the matter. Then again, they might have just been solidified.
I have no problem with the consumption of alcohol, by a non-muslim or by a muslim. Where I have a problem with, is intoxication and the resulting stupidity that ensues. And then again, that is a personal opinion. I am glad to be living in a country where a &lsquo;majority&rsquo; of people won&rsquo;t moan at me for my personal opinions.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">I think finally I would like to write about how this blog is set up, for all you geeks out there, I am sure you might enjoy this.
So let us begin!
##Jekyll and all that
Jekyll, is a simple static blogging system, or as they say, blogging for hackers. Basically, it eliminates the database from the backend. All that is there is your content (posts) and that is it. No database to store all that content, and retrive it when a user requests to view a post, hence making it blazing fast.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">So I have had some feedback from some of you who have read the recent posts (I know they are not a lot). And it has been most helpful.
Basic points that came out of the feedback are summarised as follows:
 Injustice posts seem to be mostly rambling. I understand that these are first drafts that were mainly published to get feedback from you guys in the first place, but that does not excuse bad quality.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">When we talk about abuses of women and generally labour in our country we cry foul at all stages. Women are abused, downtrodden and generally not held in the highest regard in our society. Not taking anything away from those abuses, they are horrible in their own right. But today I wanted to just talk about the post over at BBC that I read a while back. Namely, the abuse of women in Melilla, and specifically their abuse as mules for transport of goods.</p>

Pakistan is not the same as you remember it to be.
Thinks have changed.
And so on.
Granted those arguments are valid. And the reasons for which I left my country are still valid to this day from when I left.</p>
