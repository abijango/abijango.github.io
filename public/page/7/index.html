  <h3 class="h2 post-title">On India&#39;s Mission to Mars </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Our neighbours over in India have a plan to launch a space mission to Mars.
 The Mangalyaan probe was to have been launched as early as 28 October, but rough weather in the Pacific forced officials to delay the launch by a week. The unmanned mission has a launch window lasting until 19 November.
 Meanwhile in Pakistan we still concern ourselves with useless issues like what our Northern province should be called?</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Injustice for All: A Little South of Sanity </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">The laughter is the first thing that gets to most people. The shriekers, the wailers. And then those who snicker as if they know something you don&rsquo;t. Makes more than a few wonder if it&rsquo;s in fact the patients who know more than you. That they are privy to secrets that you are not. Maybe feeling that way is what drives most people away from places like this. An asylum.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Flicking the cigarette and taking a swig from the half drunk cup of coffee, he sighed. Out came the smoke in misty curls. He half tried to make rings, failed miserably and gave up. He was never very good at that. Looking out the window to his scenic view, the first thing that you saw was the criss-crossed wires. Telephone wires, electricity wires, bloody everything else wires. Covered in dirt and bird shit and god knows what else.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Injustice for All </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">I have been writing short stories since I was very young. Most of them used to be nothing more than just childhood fiction. These days I am more interested in writing about certain aspects of my culture. Highlighting certain issues if you will.
The future posts that follow with the titles beginning with &ldquo;Injustice for All&rdquo;, will be part of short stories that are linked in one way or another; and where I try to fit together these disjointed stories about things that I want to highlight about my culture.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">On the NUST fines/issues </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">I will start this by saying I attended E&amp;ME College, NUST from 2003-2007. Hence, I have a very personal taste on these issues that everyone is talking about. To get it out of the way, EM&amp;E College, NUST was a horrible place to study. Simply terri-bad. I have spent years of my life after my time there trying to erase it from my memory. Granted I met some of my best friends in that university, but most if not all friendships were based on our mutual hatred of EM&amp;E and its administration.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">My take on Woman, thy place is at home </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">I read an article over at Messy Thoughts which I think is an excellent take on the issue of &lsquo;useless education&rsquo;. Go ahead read it first and come back, I&rsquo;ll wait.
I am totally for education itself and improving oneself, but to get a degree and not use it, is an insult to education itself. Maybe you say, it is their own (or their parent&rsquo;s atleast) money, and it is for them to do with as they will.</p>

As such, this will be a collection of all the small titbits I write, along with links and my personal comments on the articles I find interesting and those that make it to my reading lists.</p>
