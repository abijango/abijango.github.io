  <h3 class="h2 post-title">A Brief History of Star Wars Canon </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Star Wars has always had a special place in my heart. I write and tweet about it a lot. Maybe too much.
Nah!
After I had devoured the movies over and over again as a kid, I was left hanging. I wanted more. I wanted the Episodes I-III (OK maybe in hindsight I should have been careful what I wished for!), and there was nothing. I am sure it was much worse for the people for whom Star Wars had been a part of their lives since the late 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">What a really thourough investigation. Every single piece of clothing (no shoes sadly) calatalogued. The little nerd in me wants to do re-runs now (No Timothy Dalton, no way!).
 Though there are 28 dinner jackets, there are 29 shirts. George Lazenby wears two different ruffled shirts with the same dinner jacket in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service. Also, shoes are unfortunately missing from this infographic since they are rarely seen in the films.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">The paintings of the Original Star Wars Trilogy </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Talk about a childhood destroyed. I always thought they created this somehow, miniatures or something. But paintings? Wow!
 Matte paintings are fake sets that—most of the times—used to be made with plexiglass and oil paint. The artists used oversized panels to create the necessary detail that the camera needed to fool the audiences when the film was projected over the large surface of the theater screen. The paintings were combined with live action filmed to match the perspective of the painting.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Pro-democracy riots in Hong Kong. Note the similarities in the police actions and the reactions by the public to what is recently happening back home in Pakistan.
 The government urdged the protesters to end their sit-in demonstrations.
 Now why would people do that? Why is it that everywhere protests start &ndash; Pakistan, UK, Hong Kong, elsewhere &ndash; the authorities always have their ridiculous demands about not protesting? Why? Other than the authourities, who else benifits from not protesting?</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">For less than the price of a Hollywood movie </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">I wrote about India&rsquo;s mission to Mars a while back, and now that spaceship has finally reached Mar&rsquo;s orbit.
And all of this for less than the cost of what it took to make Gravity.
I think the New York Time&rsquo;s article say&rsquo;s it best though.
 One a shoestring, India sends orbiter to Mars on it&rsquo;s first try.
 The trip cost India $74 million. Gravity on the other hand cost $100 million.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Chris Avellone has been one of my childhood heroes since a friend of mine told me to go read the credits on our favourite game of all time, Fallout 2. Him and the other&rsquo;s who made the amazing games over at Black Isle Studios just made my childhood amazing.
I now get to see a loot at what he uses as a gaming machine and his general desk and place of work/fun, great insight.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Censorship </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Stories like these might sound sensational to you. Yes they are trying to paint a very bleak picture of our society and the kind of censorship that is prevalent. But it doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that it is censorship.
 Today&rsquo;s edition of The International New York Times was stripped of its cover story in Pakistan. Instead of seeing a lengthy report on &ldquo;What Pakistan knew about bin Laden,&rdquo; readers were greeted with an enormous section of white space that dominates the paper&rsquo;s front page.</p>
