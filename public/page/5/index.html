  <h3 class="h2 post-title">The Official Star Wars Universe Just...Expanded </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">So this just basically means that the new movies could draw their inspiration from some of the richest stories ever told in science fiction. Hell yes!
Here&rsquo;s to hoping Disney picks up on the nerdgasms this has generated in the Star Wars community and decide to actually pick some of the most amazing story lines for the upcoming movies or animated series/films.
 So if by Episode VIII fans meet Grand Admiral Thrawn, all the better.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Finally an answer to: How long is the Runway in Fast 6? </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Totally useless bit of information, but it has nagged me since I saw the movie. My estimates were around ~26km, accounting for the scenes that could have taken place in parallel. Seems like the guys over in BBC had the same idea.
 Our best estimate after calculating plane speed, car speed and simultaneous action sequences is that the runway is 18.37 miles (29.6km) long. Which is still very long when you consider the longest paved runway in the world is the Qamdo Bamda airport in China, at around 3.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">I do experiment a little with Paper by 53 from time to time, actually this blog is sort of inspired by the man Michael Rose himself. I also sketch traditionally sometimes, have for many years; but looking at this, I am blown away. The patience and skill required to do something like this is just staggering. I wish one day I will have even a 10th of what Kyle has.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Amazing interview. From the scale of Amazon&rsquo;s operations, to the forward thinking ideas (some very sci-fi), and just the general philosophy. Jeff Bezos:
 Jeff Bezos: The long term approach is rare enough that it means you&rsquo;re not competing against very many companies. &lsquo;Cause most companies wanna see a return on investment in, you know, one, two, three years.
Charlie Rose: You donâ€™t care about that?
Jeff Bezos: I care, but I&rsquo;m willing for it to be five, six, seven years.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">I read a very thought provoking post over at Messy Thoughts and the following discussion regarding the post was insanely entertaining. Lots of self-righteousness rearing its ugly head and all that fun stuff.
Let me go over into a rant on the subject now. I have been contemplating this whole idea about Religion and Logic and blind-faith and all that stuff for a long time. I am very thankful that I had a grandfather who was very challenging in this regard, always made me question everything and always said:</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Tolerance, or lack thereof </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Well written article over at the Tribune. I especially like the fact that the write starts to explain what her interpretation of the events of Karballa were, then leaves them out, as that is not what the post was about. It was about one thing, tolerance.
We pride ourselves in being Muslims, followers of the best religion known to mankind. And yet we are the scum of the earth. If something our our religion had actually gone through our goddamn thick skulls we would respect our fellow man&rsquo;s difference of opinion and let them live their lives in peace.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Got linked to this article on Facebook. What an insane story of intelligence and wisom displayed by a maid.
Granted their situation was a difficult one, and it is all on the in-laws of the widow who gave her so much difficulty in the first place, but it is inspiring to know that there are brave and intelligent people out in the world.
The problem of the widow can be summed up in this one sentence:</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Hahahahahahaha.
Ok enough making fun of the situation (not really!). We can all point fingers, but the fact of the matter is, this is extremely sad.
Quick quote:
 &ldquo;The Army lost track of roughly $5.8 billion worth of supplies between 2003 and 2011.&rdquo;
 Kind of reminds me of another army.

  <p class="post-summary">The internet is flush with articles on the BatKid story.
 &ldquo;The Make-A-Wish Foundation has often arranged elaborate gifts for kids with life-threatening diseases - but never at this scale&hellip;&rdquo;
&ldquo;We were here to cheer on Miles, but Miles also helped us&hellip;&rdquo;
 Stories like these start to restore my faith in humanity, but then there are always the naysayers:
 Not everyone felt the love. While city police officials said they handled Friday&rsquo;s crowds without extra staffing or costs, some thought the event focused too much energy on one child.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">The Abuses in Orthodox Communities </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Disclaimer: The link post and the following article is extremely graphic. Read at your own risk.
There have been countless stories of abuse in our society, and reading this post, I wanted to highlight how it&rsquo;s not just us who have this problem; but the cases are highly similar as are their outcomes. The absolutely disgusting behavior occurs everywhere, and though we are no stranger to such stories, it is still worth discussion in my opinion.</p>
