  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Fight Club in 2 minutes </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Fight Club is, and always will be one of my favourite movies. Call it a hunger for violence, or a passion for dark gritty stories. I don&rsquo;t care, I love this movie. And for you who can&rsquo;t stand the original because of its violence (I pity you!), go ahead and watch this 2 minute version.
It blends the original story with the classic Sega games like Streets of Rage style graphics, classic!</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">How the World Wars inspired the Millennium Falcon </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">The Millennium Falcon is no doubt some of the most recognizable nerd craft. The article traces the inspirations:
 The connections begin in the cockpit of the Falcon with its iconic greenhouse-style window. It was here that audiences first jumped to hyperspace, and from these famous viewports that Han Solo evaded Imperial ships in the asteroid field above Hoth. Thirty years earlier, this same style of cockpit was found flying aboard one of the most advanced bomber aircraft of World War II: The American B-29 Superfortress.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">The Lego Movie </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">With a 96% critics rating and a 92% audience rating, you know this movie has done something right. It is a family movie, so go in obviously expecting that. But given that, I enjoyed it more than I ever imagined.
The little details, the references. The way the references were handled, even the overall main and underlying stories; typical as they were, were pretty good. Not all entertainment needs to be vulgar to make it big.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Sacrifice </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">##Women
All of what is written in the linked article is true, women are generally expected to make all the sacrifices for a marriage; or more accurately, trained to believe to give up all their hopes and dreams and live according to the lives their husbands choose for them.
And no matter how much we want it to be not true, it is. Even the modern woman feels the pressure from family and society to conform to these social norms.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">House of Cards and China </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Many of you watch this series, and many of you love it. It may be the acting or the overly dramatized politics. There is no doubt House of Cards is a very popular series, not even going into how amazing it is that Netflix is making such amazing original content, as that is a whole seperate post; let&rsquo;s talk about its popularity abroad.
To say Chinese people get the wrong idea of American politics by watching this series is again a half statement.</p>

 Here’s what I WOULDN’T do in the pilot: Kill Thomas and Martha Wayne.
 Yes, yes we all know that is the defining moment in Bruce&rsquo;s career to becoming Batman.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Is Iron Man made of Lego? </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">So it seems like Tony Stark is also a fan of Lego. Or his captors are? In either case it is always pretty funny when movies/series use code copied from somewhere, but in this case it looks like one of the designers had a sense of humour.
 The code above comes from a firmware downloader for the RCX (a programmable, microcontroller-based Lego brick), written in 1998 at Stanford University by Kekoa Proudfoot.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Absolutely hilarious. I love my hometown, and yes before you ask, it IS better than its twin city. Love how the writer illustrates the different divides within the city with such humour.
There are always comparions made by Lahori-ites and Karachi-ites about how their cities have so much happening, and Islamabad is boring and lame and all that. To that I would like to quote a friend, &ldquo;Jealous not, Darrrlinnnggg!!&rdquo;</p>
