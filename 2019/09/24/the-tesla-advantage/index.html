</header><p>From industry expert analysis:</p><blockquote>
<p>Even modern EVs from veteran carmakers are finding it hard to match the Roadsterâ€™s 245-mile EPA range. The Audi e-tron, for example, just has 204 miles of range per charge, while the award-winning I-PACE has an EPA rating of 234 miles per charge.</p></blockquote><p>Teslaâ€™s advantage or so, can be narrowed down to a few things:</p><p>All-electric only design, instead of converting existing platforms for EVs.</p><p>Battery pack/cell design. The Tesla/Panasonic battery/cell and pack design is superior to the competition.</p><p>Cell chemistry. Since Tesla spent all of their 16 year history in advancing cell chemistry and tech, they are way ahed in that aspect.</p><p>I know a lot of people complain about bad service (not my personal experience), or issues with manufacturing, panel gaps and what not (what a useless thing to be worried about. It is something that can be fixed. How will a bad design for battery pack or a half-assed attempt at converting an ICE platform for EV be fixed later?) and those are true to some extent, and we need to hold Tesla to higher standards, and they are improving. Go check out their latest cars. No more issues than you would find with any other manufacturer.</p><p>Stop listening to all the companies dragging their feet and stop being stuck to legacy, try out the future. I did and I do not regret it.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: I am an admitted Tesla fanboy. I also put my money where my mouth is and bought a Tesla.
