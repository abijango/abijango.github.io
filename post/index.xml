If you are interested in that, I am sure there are many, many posts online comparing this car to every possible car out there.
This is just my experience and impressions of how and where my obsession with Tesla started, a short history down memory lane, and how I found the process of buying and owning this in a daily capacity.</description></item><item><title>How Iceland reduced teenage substance abuse</title><link>https://abijango.github.io/2020/03/03/how-iceland-reduced-teenage-substance-abuse/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Mar 2020 09:56:03 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://abijango.github.io/2020/03/03/how-iceland-reduced-teenage-substance-abuse/</guid><description>It all started with psychologist asking the right questions:
‚ÄúAny college kid could say: why do they start? Well, there‚Äôs availability, they‚Äôre risk-takers, alienation, maybe some depression,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut why do they continue? So I got to the question about the threshold for abuse and the lights went on ‚Äì that‚Äôs when I had my version of the ‚Äòaha‚Äô experience: they could be on the threshold for abuse before they even took the drug, because it was their style of coping that they were abusing.</description></item><item><title>Worship at the altar of Acros</title><link>https://abijango.github.io/2020/02/06/worship-at-the-altar-of-acros/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2020 15:34:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://abijango.github.io/2020/02/06/worship-at-the-altar-of-acros/</guid><description>The Fujifilm Neopan Acros or simple Acros as it is referred to, is sadly one of the discontinued film stocks that Fujifilm produced for many years. Though there is some rumours that it might come back, ü§ûüèΩ.
The Fujifilm X-series cameras from the X-Pro2 onwards, X-T2, X100F and all the newer ones have the Acros film simulation built into the cameras. This is one of the reasons I stuck to Fuji cameras when at first I had picked up the X-T2 somewhat by accident.</description></item><item><title>Nintendo Switch overtakes SNES with more than 52 million sold</title><link>https://abijango.github.io/2020/01/31/nintendo-switch-overtakes-snes-with-more-than-52-million-sold/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2020 09:54:17 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://abijango.github.io/2020/01/31/nintendo-switch-overtakes-snes-with-more-than-52-million-sold/</guid><description>John Gruber writing over at Daring Fireball, linking to an article for the Verge:
The Switch is a hit because the games are great, but the OS is also a triumph, and contributes to the joyfulness of using it.
I‚Äôve only played a few Switch games when a friend generously lent me his Switch to try out Breath of the Wild (An amazing game), but besides the games, the Switch is a delight to use.</description></item><item><title>Self Driving DeLorean is taught to Drift</title><link>https://abijango.github.io/2020/01/02/self-driving-delorean-is-taught-to-drift/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 15:51:09 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://abijango.github.io/2020/01/02/self-driving-delorean-is-taught-to-drift/</guid><description>This is just insane!

I especially liked this tidbit:
Want to run Docker for Windows on your brand new Surface Laptop 3? Sorry, can‚Äôt do that without buying an upgrade to Windows Pro (the $1800 Surface Laptop 3 apparently wasn‚Äôt expensive enough to warrant that designation, so it ships with the Home edition. Okay, sheesh).

Even modern EVs from veteran carmakers are finding it hard to match the Roadster‚Äôs 245-mile EPA range. The Audi e-tron, for example, just has 204 miles of range per charge, while the award-winning I-PACE has an EPA rating of 234 miles per charge.
Tesla‚Äôs advantage or so, can be narrowed down to a few things:
All-electric only design, instead of converting existing platforms for EVs.</description></item><item><title>A day in London with family</title><link>https://abijango.github.io/2019/09/24/a-day-in-london-with-family/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2019 11:53:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://abijango.github.io/2019/09/24/a-day-in-london-with-family/</guid><description>A few images from the day roaming the streets of London.

First, nobody or almost nobody who is crying wolf has had a chance to shoot with this camera yet. Luckily, it appears that a physical camera is no longer needed to prove its usefulness to the world. People just know! What a brilliant bunch! Saves a lot of hassle.</description></item><item><title>Twitter Gold as usual</title><link>https://abijango.github.io/2019/09/17/twitter-gold-as-usual/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2019 16:02:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://abijango.github.io/2019/09/17/twitter-gold-as-usual/</guid><description>Oh how much would I like to work at SpaceX or Tesla! üò≠

Out of all the Marvel TV series, I think Daredevil was clearly the best, with Punisher a close second. I think they lost the plot with Iron Fist and Luke Cage (really? What was that). Jessica Jones was just OK.
There is so much more that can be done with the medium and the stories coming straight of the comics, modified for modern TV audiences, see HBO Watchmen.</description></item><item><title>Deepest place on earth</title><link>https://abijango.github.io/2019/09/17/deepest-place-on-earth/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2019 13:59:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abijango.github.io/2019/09/17/deepest-place-on-earth/</guid><description>I love the Kurzgesagt videos!
