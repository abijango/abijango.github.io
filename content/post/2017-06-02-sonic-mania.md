OMG OMG OMG!

2D Sonic once again! Yay! Childhood favourite game revival. These days nostalgia is all the rage, but still, this is Sonic!

> Sonic Mania, which is being developed by Headcannon and PagodaWest Games in collaboration with Sega and Christian Whitehead, will offer a mix of new levels and updated versions of classic Sonic stages. Sonic the hedgehog, Tails the fox and Knuckles the echidna will all appear in the game.

Pre-ordered already! Can't wait for August!
