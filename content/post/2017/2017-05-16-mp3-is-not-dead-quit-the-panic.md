People can't really be blamed for losing their shit. All the click-bait articles were not helping. But seriously, everything is fine.

> But the “death” of the MP3 is really not much of a death at all. The files will not spontaneously combust. You'll still be able to buy and use MP3s. They will not suddenly stop playing.

> All this really does is move the classification of MP3 from being recognized as a file format of the moment to being a file format of the past.
