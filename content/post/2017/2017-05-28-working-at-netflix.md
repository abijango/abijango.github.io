Just a small reminder to all of us that work environments do not need to be vile swamps filled with politics and nonsense. There are great places to work out there, we just haven't found them yet.

> The actual company values, as opposed to the nice-sounding values, are shown by who gets rewarded, promoted, or let go

The excuses that this is the way the work environments are and there is no way to change them is just plain bullshit. Also:

>  I've noticed a widespread cynicism about successful companies, especially US corporates, where it's assumed that they must be doing something shady to be really competitive. Like selling customer data, or making it difficult to terminate membership. It's been amazing and inspiring to see how Netflix operates, contrary to this belief. We don't do anything shady, and we're proud of that. We're an honest company.
