So many years into Android and the adoption rate of the latest OS version is still a major shit show. OEM's doing their own thing and carriers opting for their own brand of "let's see how much we can fuck with the customers".

> What a difference between the two platforms. The largest issue caused by this fragmentation is the inability to get critical updates out to the masses. Apple is about to release a brand new OS, and it will work on the vast majority of iPhones in the wild. And there are no carriers or third party manufacturers that stand in between users and their updates.
