It went almost exactly how you would expect :)

I especially liked this tidbit:

> Want to run Docker for Windows on your brand new Surface Laptop 3? Sorry, canâ€™t do that without buying an upgrade to Windows Pro (the $1800 Surface Laptop 3 apparently wasnâ€™t expensive enough to warrant that designation, so it ships with the Home edition. Okay, sheesh).
