I want Daredevil back! Out of all the Marvel TV series, I think Daredevil was clearly the best, with Punisher a close second. I think they lost the plot with Iron Fist and Luke Cage (really? What was that). Jessica Jones was just OK.

There is so much more that can be done with the medium and the stories coming straight of the comics, modified for modern TV audiences, see [HBO Watchmen][1].
