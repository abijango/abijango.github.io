My name is Naufal Mir. I am just a regular guy, living in London at the moment. I am highly opinionated and think too highly of myself. I write most of my opinionated pieces here on this blog, along with links to articles I find interesting plus a few original short story fiction pieces.

I am very into discussing ideas; especially controversial stuff, hence the nature of most of my posts. I encourage you to get in touch to speak your mind if you disagree with me, or the less likely chance that you agree with me :); or just to say hi. All the usual social network links can be found below, I am most active on Twitter, that is usually the best place to get in touch.
